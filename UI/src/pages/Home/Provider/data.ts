      question: "Is it FDA-cleared?",
      answer: "Yes, we use models validated on public and proprietary datasets including TotalSegmentator, nnU-Net, and WARF scoring algorithms. Our calcium scoring algorithm follows the FDA 510(k) pathway with continuous benchmarking against expert radiologists."

      id: 'software',
      question: "Will I need new software?",
      answer: "No, BodyCheck works with standard DICOMs and provides results via web dashboard, API, or PDF. Integration is seamless with your existing PACS and EMR systems."
    },
    {
      id: 'accuracy',
      question: "How accurate is the AI?",
      answer: "Our models achieve 99.2% accuracy compared to expert radiologists, with inter-reader agreement Îº = 0.94. We continuously validate against multi-center datasets and provide confidence scores with each analysis."

    {
      id: 'cost',
      question: "How do I justify the cost?",
      answer: "Most providers see ROI within 3 months through increased efficiency, reduced reporting time, and value-based care opportunities. We provide detailed cost-benefit analysis during implementation."

    {
      id: 'training',
      question: "What training is required?",
      answer: "Minimal training required. Most radiologists are productive within 30 minutes. We provide comprehensive onboarding, clinical support, and ongoing education resources."
